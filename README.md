### [Project #1 - 🍿 Investigate a Relational Database](https://github.com/tuckercp/Udacity-Programming-for-Data-Science-ND/tree/main/Project-1-Investigate-Relational-DB)
🔑 **Key Learnings:**
* Learn SQL language fundamentals such as basic queries and advanced functions like Window Functions, Subqueries and Common Table Expressions

I generated a series of questions to be answered through SQL queries with the goal of gaining a better understanding of the company's customer base. Each query included a supporting visualization and summary of the findings from the questions.

### [Project #2 - 🚲 Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/tuckercp/Exploring-US-Bike-Share-Data/blob/master/bikeshare.py)
🔑 **Key Learnings:**
* Learn Python programming fundamentals such as data types and structures, variables, loops, and functions

I developed a Python script using pandas that takes raw input from the user and creates an interactive experience exploring bike sharing data between 3 major US cities. I generated summary statistics based on the appropriate filters applied to the DataFrame. Users are also given the option to view raw data sequentially.
