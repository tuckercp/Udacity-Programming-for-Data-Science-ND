## Project #1 - üçø Investigate a Movie Rental Database

### Project Summary
This project involves writing and executing SQL queries to explore the Sakila Movie Rental database. The SQL queries will be used to gain a deeper understanding of the company and their customer base, i.e. movie-watching patterns across customer groups, store performance comparisons, etc. The project submission will consist of a slide presentation containing data visualizations derived from the output of the queries.

### Tools & Technologies

* SQL
* Excel
* Powerpoint
* Juypter Notebook

### Database Used
The data comes from a sample database called the [Sakila Sample Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/), originally created by MySQL. The schema is modeled after a DVD rental store company, consisting of various tables and relationships regarding movie rentals, inventory levels, film actors, as well as customer, staff and store information. The Sakila repository available [here](https://github.com/jOOQ/sakila) on Github has been cloned to this repo as well. If you would like to view the database on your local machine, navigate to the Sakila repo and select the folder with the RDBMS you plan to use. Download the appropriate .sql files to create the schema for the database and insert the data.

### Additional Information
My original queries were run while working within PostgreSQL. Each of the queries were then exported to Excel whereby I used Powerpoint to create the slides for the presentation. For the purposes of displaying my work here, I have created a Juypter notebook with the queries and slides embedded within.
